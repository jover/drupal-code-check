## Description

This Git pre-commit hook will be active on your Composer based Drupal project.

Things which will be checked in the pre-commit hook:

* Syntax checking using _PHP Linter_
* Automatically try to match code style via _PHP Code Sniffer Beautifier and Fixer_
* Coding standards checking using _PHP Code Sniffer_
* Blacklisted strings checking/validation

Note that files of the following origins are **not checked**:

* Drupal Core
* Contributed Modules
* Contributed Libraries
* Contributed Themes
* Contributed Profiles

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* Composer
* Composer based Drupal project
* PHP 5.4 or higher

### Installation

Add this project as a composer dependency on your Composer based Drupal project.

```bash
composer require jover_be/drupal-code-check
```

And don't forget to update...

```bash
composer update jover_be/drupal-code-check
```

In order to activate the Git Hooks, update your composer.json file like following:

```
{
    "scripts": {
        "post-install-cmd": [
            "jover_be\\drupal_code_check\\GitHooks::create"
        ],
        "post-update-cmd": [
        	"jover_be\\drupal_code_check\\GitHooks::create"
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Development requirement

In case you want to install it as a development requirement (_require-dev_),
make use of the project _neronmoon/scriptsdev_ in order to execute the
scripts only in case your project was installed in development mode.

```bash
composer require --dev neronmoon/scriptsdev
composer require --dev jover_be/drupal-code-check
```

And instead, you should be using the _scripts-dev_ part as described by 

```
{
    "extra": {
        "scripts-dev": {
            "post-install-cmd": [
                "jover_be\\drupal_code_check\\GitHooks::create"
            ],
            "post-update-cmd": [
                "jover_be\\drupal_code_check\\GitHooks::create"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
